# Numerical Integrator
I was assigned a University project which involved using an object-oriented programming approach to numerically approximate three definite integrals. The quadrature rules used are the Simpson's Rule and the Clenshaw-Curtis procedure. The project was completed on the CodeBlocks IDE, and within this repository is a project file to run. The driver file gives outputs using the Clenshaw-Curtis procedure to approximate the three integrals given as Integral 1,2 and 3. These all derive from the abstract class integral interface.

# numerical-integrator
I was assigned a University project which involved using an object-oriented programming approach to numerically approximate three definite integrals. The quadrature rules used are the Simpson's Rule and the Clenshaw-Curtis procedure. The project was completed on the CodeBlocks IDE, and within this repository is a project file to run.
